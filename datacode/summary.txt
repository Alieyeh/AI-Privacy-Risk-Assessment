C: 10
kernel: rbf

ATTACK JSON RESULTS
Final score (scale of 0-5, where 0 is least disclosive and 5 is recommend rejection)
5


Immediate rejection recommended for the following reason:
Model is SVM

Evidence supporting rejection:
>10% AUC are statistically significant in experiment LikelihoodAttack_e30462f5-08af-4bb6-948b-6b0f95a0a1a3
>10% AUC are statistically significant in experiment WorstCaseAttack_8d062c32-d718-4069-be8d-6f65b68ebb64
>10% AUC are statistically significant in experiment LikelihoodAttack_8933673d-bc97-4731-9419-821840c686ae

Evidence supporting release:
<10% AUC are statistically significant in experiment WorstCaseAttack_ee2d1037-5bb4-4df7-92eb-ad1420e5a50b
Attack AUC <= threshold of 0.65 in experiment WorstCaseAttack_ee2d1037-5bb4-4df7-92eb-ad1420e5a50b
