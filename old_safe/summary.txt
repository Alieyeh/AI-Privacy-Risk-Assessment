ATTACK JSON RESULTS
Final score (scale of 0-5, where 0 is least disclosive and 5 is recommend rejection)
4


Immediate rejection recommended for the following reason:
None

Evidence supporting rejection:
>10% AUC are statistically significant in experiment LikelihoodAttack_6c7105d2-1d1a-4a30-96fd-a8fbdec60472
>10% AUC are statistically significant in experiment AttributeAttack_1e9b56a2-8516-4af2-9707-707aefd72e53

Evidence supporting release:
<10% AUC are statistically significant in experiment WorstCaseAttack_16563f3c-7621-451d-ba0a-40200b805049
Attack AUC <= threshold of 0.65 in experiment WorstCaseAttack_16563f3c-7621-451d-ba0a-40200b805049
Attack AUC <= threshold of 0.65 in experiment LikelihoodAttack_6c7105d2-1d1a-4a30-96fd-a8fbdec60472
Attack AUC <= threshold of 0.65 in experiment AttributeAttack_1e9b56a2-8516-4af2-9707-707aefd72e53
